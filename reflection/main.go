	Reflection is the ability of a program to inspect its variables and values at run time and find their type.
	The first question anyone gets when learning about reflection is why do we even need to inspect a variable and
	find its type at runtime when each and every variable in our program is defined by us and we know its type at
	compile time itself. The data that your application process will be different at run time, that is the quickest
	answer.
